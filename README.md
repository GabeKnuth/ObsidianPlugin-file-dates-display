# ObsidianPlugin-file-dates-display
Shows file created and updated date in an unobtrusive, dynamic way.

The way Obsidian does this out of the box, or with plugins, didn't fit with my workflow/expectations, especially moving from Evernote. This is a dead simple plugin that shows the file's created/updated dates above the title of the note.
